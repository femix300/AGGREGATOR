# MERIT

## A program that helps check if students are qualified to study their dream course in their dream University by using their credentials.

This project was built to aid Nigerian students in their admission process into tetiary Institutions. It helps students to make the right choices when it comes to matters pertaining to course and Institution. Not only does it do this in a very short time, but it also makes the whole process far more easier and less stressful. Here are some very important features of Merit.

* Calculating a student's aggregate score by using their credentials e.g olevel, UTME, and POST UTME results.
* Predicting the POST UTME score a student needs to achieve in order to be considered for admission.
* Letting the User know whether they are qualified to study their dream course or not.
* Recommendig other courses which they are qualified to study.
* Displaying to the student the score needed in order to study their course of choice in their dream university.
* Basic info about a selected University.
* Listing out all courses (undergraduate) offered in a selected University.
* Listing out all the faculties and courses (undergraduate) under them.
* Displaying the list of universities currently supported by Merit.
